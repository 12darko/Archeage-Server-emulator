## Explain Explain
As you can see, I'm working on a fix for it, and I do not know where its source comes from, but it does make sense to start the basic simulation. Obviously this is an abandoned project, a lot of functions have not been realized. I was fortunate enough to find this project and have now started a basic restoration of it. In addition to the verification section of the account, I've fixed the server list display and asked to connect to the game server, which is a great start. However, the simulation workload for the game is too large, there is no source code for the client I can not go deeper to repair.
Now looking for more people to join this impossible project, while seeking ways to start the client need to completely separate the GLYPH platform, because I directly run archeage.exe is not responding, I do not know how to solve this problem.
Any questions can be contacted by mail: ahlyl94@gmail.com
But I may read my email rarely and can not reply to you anytime anywhere
I introduced in the source third-party AALauncher launcher, and ultimately all the original author of all, of course, we will later replace the starter
If you want to start directly please cmd code:

- {g} + auth_ip 127.0.0.1:1237 -uid {id} -token {token} archeage.exe -r + auth_ip 127.0.0.1:1237 -uid 1 -token e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
g:

r: Russia (normal) t: America (failure) k: Korea (failure) eu: EU (failure) ...
id:

Account id in the database
token:

32 hexadecimal characters of length: e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
The copyright of the program netcastiel I do not know is a person or organization name, but repair copyright belongs to I, Yanlongli.

When I tried to fix the program, I found that a lot of data was undefined
I use Glyph platform North American server 208.94.25.230 help me to resume work
I got the communication between the two through the capture tool, and then sent a fake list of servers using the emulator, and I'm honored that I succeeded, but! ! !
When we selected the server after the client disconnected the login server, start connecting to the game server, and the large amount of communication between the unexpected and I began to understand that this is not a person's job.
However, I submitted the source code again, hoping to come to continue this project

Debugging process
Through the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015+ version
After editing, modify ArcheAgeLogin and ArcheAge
Configure MYSQL, account: root, password: root, and import the following sql ArcheAgeLogin
Installation number Glyph platform archeage Open the software root directory Glyph \ Library \ GlyphLibrary.xml and modify the IP address of about 178 lines to 127.0.0.1 and set the file to read-only mode (to restore simply turn off read-only or direct Delete the file)
Then you can continue my work
